# Encrypt It

A new Flutter application.
The application encrypts texts with complex mathematical equations and application-specific encryption algorithms with a complete change in the text letters and their arrangement, which gives more protection and security so that the ciphertext is completely different every time the same text is encrypted.

## What is text encryption?

Encryption is a process of converting plain text characters into other characters and symbols to produce an unintelligible ciphertext to keep the original text secret.

## What is special about this app?

* The text is encrypted using **application-specific algorithms** and with special characters in a special order (Arabic and English characters, numbers, and some symbols).
* It generates a **completely different ciphertext every time the same text is encrypted** which gives more protection and security.
* Protect the ciphertext with a password you type, and the ciphertext can only be decrypted using the same password with which the plain text has encrypted.
* The encrypted texts can be easily stored within the application in the **"Text Store"** for easy access at any time later and decrypted using its own password.
* The application interface is very simple and easy to use.
